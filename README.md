# Mikktspace.hx

This is a direct port / translation of mikktspace, originally written by Morten S. Mikkelsen.

The only changes made to the code was to enable it to compile in Haxe, and hence might be less-than-optimal.
The code is self-contained and has no dependencies.

Note that I only did a single test with a teapot mesh.
